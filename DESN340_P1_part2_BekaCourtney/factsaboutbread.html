        	<p>A rolled-up piece of white bread was used to erase graphite before rubber erasers were invented.<br>
			Within five years of the invention of the machine for making sliced bread, 80% of bread sold in the USA was sliced.<br>
			In medieval times, bread was used as an absorbent plate. It was called a trencher. And after the meal, trenchers could be eaten, given to people experiencing poverty, or fed to dogs. There is a theory that a pizza comes from a trencher.<br>
			A “baker's dozen” is a phrase that means 13 items. The practice comes from medieval times when bread was sold in small loaves, most often in standard dozens of 12 pieces. Some loaves were lighter than others because bakers tried to rob on weight or because of different weights of ingredients; not all dozens were equal. Strict laws were made that required bread to be sold by weight. By adding loaf to the dozen, customers were getting weight by the law.</p>
